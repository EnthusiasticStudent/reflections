What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google

and are not just contingent on there being any change. The con is that you might
forget to commit and loose progress.

	This is for porgrammers. Often code is broken up into multiple files. 
Allowing a commit of multiple files means that version of the project has might 
have working code.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
