When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you are collaborating on a project or when you want a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	If you are currently updating the project any changes by someone else could break your version or vice versa.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	A fork and a clone are the same the only difference is that a fork is a clone of a repository on github and a clone is a clone of a repository from github on your local computer. A repository can have several branches. These branches are different versions of the files with separate history up until a point. You would fork a project you do not have access to edit and then clone it. When working on it or another project you are collaborating on you would create branches.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	You are working on the most up to date system and merging takes less processing.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	Without using github you could collaborate in several different ways. Keeping one up-to date copy is a way and sharing it among each other. That would prevent people from working on them simultaneously. Using dropbox is also an option. Merges are more difficult. Talking about who edits what is also a solution.
