When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you are collaborating on a project or when you want a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	If you are currently updating the project any changes by someone else could break your version or vice versa.
